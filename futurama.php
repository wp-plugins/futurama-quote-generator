Dr. Zoidberg: Someday they'll watch, from down in the gutter they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box!

Dr. Zoidberg: Scalpel! .... Blood-bucket! ... Priest! Next patient!

Bender: I know you're just a carbon-based life form, but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium.

Fry: It's like a party in my mouth and everyone is throwing up.
Bender: Someone's acting awfully aluminum.

Fry: Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate, but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?
Bender: Shooting DNA at each other to make babies... I find it offensive!
Bender: Congratulations Fry, you snagged a perfect girlfriend. Amy is rich, she's probably got other characteristics...
Fry: ... I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet.
Fry: Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! Actually, it wasn't hers, it was her dad's. Actually, she wasn't my girlfriend. She just lived next door and never closed her curtains.
Bender: You, sir, have defaced a national treasure. I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory!
Fry: Look, could chocolate just let me finish?
Bender: Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
Fry: No I'm.. doesn't!
Richard Nixon's Head: I remember my body. Flabby, pasty skin, riddled with phlebitis - a good Republican body. God, I loved it.
Richard Nixon's Head: Now beat it, before I get Cambodian on your asses!
Fry: Why couldn't she be the other kind of mermaid? With the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom!
Zoidberg: I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated!
Gunther: All I want out of life is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit. That's why I've decided to transfer to business school!
Richard Nixon's Head: Prepare to evacuate Earth.. I mean.. New Scamedonia.
William Shatner: We're just pawns in his diabolical game of checkers!
Richard Nixon's Head: Computers may be twice as fast as they were in 1973 but your average voter is as drunk and stupid as ever. The only one who's changed is me. I've become bitter, and let's face it, crazy over the years. And once I'm swept into office, I'll sell our children's organs to zoos for meat. And I'll go into people's houses at night and wreck up the place!
Inuitbot: Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching jerk and a hundred others. Even my best friend from aromatherapy school.
Calculon: Oh, fate most cruel, would that my boundless acting skills would avail me a sword with which to slay this wretched curse.
Bender: Give us a name, MacButt!
Bender: Let's kick him some more.
Fry: I never told anybody this, but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades, nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
Professor Farnsworth: Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
Alternate Farnsworth: Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela? Or should I say "Evila"?
Dr. Zoidberg: I ate garbage yesterday, and it didn't cost me three hundred dollars!
Bender: Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives… Free you from the complicated part, I mean, not the lives part.
Wernstrom: We laughed until our teeth fell out.
Leela: You see that giant quasar you're headed into? You might want to scooch a few parsecs to the left.
Bender: You may have to "metaphorically" make a deal with the "devil." And by "devil," I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically," I mean get your coat.
Wernstrom: Pencils down, prune-face.
Zapp Brannigan: Search them for paper! And bring me a rock.
Sal: We're all scared, it's the human condition. Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy facade?
Sal: He's busteds, let's gets hims outta heres.
Zapp Brannigan: Soo beautiful... Yet so neutral.
Robot Devil: You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
Bender: Robot porno theater? I was in that... general area last night.
Gypsy: My friend, you have nothing to worry about. Except a nightmarish life of unremitting horror!
Fry: Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me.

Dr. Zoidberg: The president is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honor!
Fry: That THAT Mr. President! Sir!
That Guy: Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany -- ambitious and misunderstood!
Bender: Oh cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones... it bones for thee.
Bender: My life, and by extension everyone else's, is meaningless.
Bender: Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!
Professor Farnsworth: Show us this "the wheel."
Solicitorbot: To my loyal butler, You There, for his decades of service, I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 equal installments of one-twentieth of a pittance each.
Thermostadt Robot: I choose to believe what I was programmed to believe!
Fry: These new hands are great! I'm gonna break 'em in tonight.
That Guy: I'm proud to be the shepherd of this herd of sharks.
Bender: You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
Roberto: I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! I'm just not user-friendly! 
Bender: Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome… handsome!
Don Bot: That wad of scab money should be slushin' my funds and kicksin' my back. 
Bender: You call yourself divorced?! You're making a mockery of one of our most oldest institutions!
Zapp Brannigan: We need rest! The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Lrrr: We will raise your planet's temperature for one million degrees a day... for five days!

Hermes: You do a nice "hand job," Zoidberg.
Bender: Scarab Forearm Bird Bird Bird!

Anglelyne: Hey, according to the Scab Handbook, that is extremely inappropriate banter.
Humorbot 5.0: Anecdote accepted. Snappy comeback not found.
Hermes: That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!
Scientist: Now that the garbage is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with your sexual inhibitions?
Fry: Bender, if this is some kind of a scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney.
Zapp Brannigan: The best way into a girl's bed is through her parents. Have sex with them, and you're in.
Bender: This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
Bender: Stupid anti-pimping laws...
Mayor Poopenmeyer: You people aren't Santa! You're not even robots! How dare you lie in front of Jesus!?
Bender: Shut up baby, I know it.
Morbo: WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY!
Lrrr: This concept of "wuv" confuses and infuriates us!
Lrrr: Why does Ross, the largest "friend" not simply eat the other five?
Fry: All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. Then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns, and also he got a race car.
Mayor Poopenmeyer: I wanna make sure this isn't another scam, like global warming, or second-hand smoke.
Dr. Zoidberg: My mother was a saint! Get out!
Hyperchicken: Now, Pramela, I know it's scary in that thar witness box, but t'aint no need to fear me.... BuCawk! ... I'm sorry, I thought you was corn.
Fry: Oh the fools! If only they'd built it with six thousand and one hulls! When will they learn??
Glurmo: This concludes the part of the tour where you stay alive.
Zapp Brannigan: Kif, I'm feeling the Captain's Itch.
Amy Wong: You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later on you realize he actually has a really good body.
Barbados Slim: I see you're still able to limbo under the bar of fashion sense?
Bender: What an awful dream! Ones and zeros everywhere... and I think I saw a two.
Professor Farnsworth: You must take him to his ancient home world, which will soon erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex.
Bender: There's nothing wrong with murder, so long as you let Bender wet his beak.
Bender: Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer "extortion." The "x" makes it sound cool.
Al Gore: If we don't go back there and make that event happen, the entire universe will be destroyed... And as an environmentalist, I'm against that.
Nichelle Nichols: Murder isn't working, and that's all we're good at.
Nichelle Nichols: An eternity with nerds. It's the Pasadena Star Trek Convention all over again.
Dr. Zoidberg: I want the tactile pleasure in cutting him here... [points to Fry's neck] in the gonads!

Bender: Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
Dr. Zoidberg: I've performed a few mercy killings...
Dr. Zoidberg: You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
Edna: Teach me to love, you squishy poet from beyond the stars.
Fry: I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big freaky mud bug, you'd be way up the list.
Bender: Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody.
Billionaire Bot: You'll be the most unpopular robot fighter since Sergeant Feces Processor.
Fry: Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling, but it turns out it's fixed, like boxing.
Bender: What do you mean "we", mammal?
Alternate Bender: Bite my glorious golden ass!
Calculon: I've seen plagues that had better opening nights than this!
Fry: *I* should be the one in that grave.
Bender: Grab a shovel. I'm one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion.
Zapp Brannigan: Oh god, I've never been so happy to be beaten up by a woman.
Amazon: It time snu-snu!

Zapp Brannigan: In the game of chess you can never let your adversary see your pieces.
Fry: Dear Horse god, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist, but if you're willing to grant me luck... please... stamp your hoof once.
Professor Farnsworth: My internet browser heard us saying the word "Fry," and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us. It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some french fries.
Star Trek Priest: ...and Scotty beamed them up to the Klingon ship, where they would be no Tribble at all...
Dr. Zoidberg: It's toe-tappingly tragic!
Bender: Okay, I'm done re-kaboobling the energymotron.. or whatever.
Leela: You can't go to Omega 3 -- it's forbidden. I forbid you!
Fry: Like a balloon, and.. something bad happens!
Melllvar's Mother: He's not a child. He's thirty-four!
Robot Santa: Your mistletoe is no match for my TOW missile!
William Shatner: When I directed Star Trek V, I got a good performance out of me, because I respected me so much!
Dr. Zoidberg: [voice-over] As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporized into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world.
God: Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you. And if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch, like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
Fry: I know Big Vinny said he was giving me the kiss of death, but I still think he was gay.
Dr. Zoidberg: Is desire to mate a feeling?
Dr. Zoidberg: Oh, it's all so complicated, with the flowers, and the romance, and the lies upon lies!
Wireframe Dummy 1: Is heaven missing an angel? 'Cause you've got nice cans!
Leela: Way to go, Fry. Now every galaxy is gonna be cracking wise about our mamas.
Hermes: I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama is not alive to see this...
Professor Farnsworth: Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes.
Bender: Take it off! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit.
Fry: I'm not a robot like you, I don't like having discs crammed into me... unless they're Oreos... and then only in the mouth.
Calculon: Have you got an extra GOTO 10 line?
Harold Zoid: People, people, please -- just because it's a dramatic scene, doesn't mean you can't do a little comedy in the background.
Ndnd: It is true what they say. Women are from Omicron Persei 7. Men are from Omicron Persei 9.
Leela: How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
Hermes: Today's mission is to go to the Brain Slug planet.
Reverend Preacherbot: Wretched sinner unit! The path to Robot Heaven lies here, in the Good Book 3.0.
Fry: I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Of course it was tough love...
Leela: Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
Lrrr: Instead of shooting where I was, you should have shot where I was going to be!
Zapp Brannigan: Now THERE's a wave of destruction that's easy on the eyes.
Professor Farnsworth: Now I'll need a fake ID to buy ultra-porn.
Professor Farnsworth: Oh, dear, I should have shown him "Electrogonorrhea: The Noisy Killer" instead.
Zapp Brannigan: That young man fills me with hope. Plus some other emotions which are weird and deeply confusing...
Planet Express Ship: You're just jealous! Nobody loves you because you're tiny and made of meat!
Zapp Brannigan: Don't ask me. You're the ones who are going to be dying.
Leela: Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator!
Zapp Brannigan: Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed from the start. I guess all that remains now is for the captain to go down with the ship.
Leela: I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse, and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane!
Professor Farnsworth: Some people think I'm robbing the cradle, but I say she's robbing the grave.
Professor Farnsworth: Oh dear, she's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot! Oh well, that's love for you, I guess.
Professor Farnsworth: It's a spaceship, damn it! Not a prom limousine!
Leela: Depth at forty five hundred feet... Forty eight hundred... Fifty hundred... Five thousand feet!
Richard Nixon's Head: Good evening, ignorant pigs. Put down your crack pipes and your beer bongs and pay attention, as I sign a historic peace accord with ambassador Kong of planet Nintendu 64.
Fry: Wait a second, I know that monkey -- his name is Donkey!
Planet Express Ship: Why not make a national endowment for strip clubs while we're at it?
Leela: Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually!
Professor Farnsworth: Monkeys aren't donkeys, quit messing with my head!
Fry: Now he's trapped in a book I wrote -- a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.
Giant Brain: The big brain am winning again! I am the greetest! I must now leave Earth for no raisin!
Planet Express Ship: Stop it! You're mussing up my trajectory!
Leela: Planet Express Ship - cover your shame!
Professor Farnsworth: Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great, but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewelry and skintight pants.
Bender: Dating a robot... it's an atrocimacy!
Bender: Would you stifle there, meatbag?
Hedonism Bot: Oh sirrah! A *man* writing an opera about a *woman*? How deliciously absurd!
Zapp Brannigan: Leela, I noticed that you're unescorted. May I escort you behind that bush?
Hedonism Bot: I apologize for nothing!
Professor Farnsworth: Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-my-own-grandfather!
